    text: `Miniatures are from the times of 11th century Greater Armenia. The patterns have been preserved to this day
             thanks to the works of the great calligrapher and miniaturist Grigor Akoretsi. For this collection we used 
             the fragments of his work on the Sebastian Gospel of 1066. The calligraphic writing of the Armenian Kingdom
              of Cilicia (1080-1375) was created based on these works. The Cilician school of miniature was especially 
              famous, whose followers became well-known masters on painting churches and for centuries, taught this craft
               other peoples.`

    text: `In this series, you see the mural of one of the most prominent Christian monuments of the 7th century - Zvartnots Cathedral 
    (from ancient Armenian literally means “Celestial Angels”). The architecture of the cathedral had a tremendous impact on the masters of that period.
     The Byzantine Emperor Constant II desired to build a similar cathedral in Constantinople. The details of Zvartnots Cathedral architecture appeared 
     on the monuments’ ornaments of different nations up to the 12th century. The architectural composition of those times was distinguished by an amazing
      constancy in the ornament motifs, persistently repeated in various combinations and structures. Remaining unchanged, the same subjects decorated the
       walls of churches and monuments in Armenia throughout the 7th century.`

    text: `This collection is dedicated to a great artist of the 20th century - Martiros Saryan. In this collection, you see details of the works of the
     great artist. As you know, the main subjects of Saryan’s art were associated with the nature and culture of Armenia, however, the details on the bags
      of this season refer to the period of Saryan 1910 - 1913, when he, having made a number of trips to Turkey, Egypt and Iran, painted pictures of oriental
       themes. Saryan himself, recalling this period of his life: “I had a goal - to understand the East, to find its characteristic features in order to
        further substantiate my searches in painting. I wanted to convey the realism of the East, to find convincing ways of depicting of this world ... 
        to reveal its new artistic understanding. <...> \"The greatest interest for me were streets, the rhythm of their life, the bright crowds of people 
        and dogs ... living here in whole family groups.\"`
